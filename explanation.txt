1. Initialize a planes variable to 0 and a currentAirport variable to 0. These variables will be used to keep track of the number of planes we've hired and the airport we're currently at, respectively.

2. Enter a while loop that will continue until we reach the last airport (the currentAirport is less than fuel.length - 1).

3. Inside the loop, initialize a farthestAirport variable to the currentAirport. This variable will be used to keep track of the farthest airport we can reach from the current airport.

4. Enter a for loop that will iterate over the airports from the current airport to the farthest airport we can reach using the fuel available at the current airport.

5. For each airport, check if we have enough fuel to reach the last airport from there. If we do, return planes + 1 (since we would need one more plane to reach the last airport).

6. If we don't have enough fuel to reach the last airport, compare the fuel at the current airport with the fuel at the farthest airport we've found so far. If the fuel at the current airport plus the current airport number is greater than the fuel at the farthest airport plus the farthest airport number, update the farthestAirport variable to the current airport. This is because we want to reach the airport that has the most fuel, so that we have a better chance of reaching the last airport.

7. After the for loop completes, check if the farthestAirport is the same as the currentAirport. If it is, it means that we couldn't find an airport to reach, so it's not possible to reach the last airport. In this case, return -1.

8. If the farthestAirport is different from the currentAirport, update the currentAirport to the farthestAirport and increment the planes variable by 1. This is because we have hired a plane to fly to the farthest airport we could reach from the current airport.

9. Go back to the beginning of the while loop and repeat the process until we reach the last airport or determine that it's not possible to reach the last airport.

10. If the while loop completes, it means that we have reached the last airport, so return the value of the planes variable.
